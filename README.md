######Converting multiple subtitle tracks into flash cards
######sub_open.py: opens ja.ass and eng.ssa, matches each entry based on time and exports each line out to the console. Works with any two subtitles despite source.

######Future plans to utilize this to export flash cards for Anki (a flashcard SRS system for learning) to help those learn Japanese. Flash cards may include snapshots in future releases to simulate a reading book experience.
